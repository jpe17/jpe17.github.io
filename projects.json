    "description": "Buiot the encoder part of the Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch in PyTorch for handwritten digit classification. The project features a real-time webcam demo that recognizes digits as you show them. This experiment highlights the classic machine learning challenge of adapting a model trained on clean data (like MNIST) to unprocessed, real-world images. The next logical step is to build a pre-processing pipeline that can automatically format the live camera feed to match the training data, dramatically improving real-world accuracy. A new project will come with the full transformers with multiple digits inference",
